# Hybrid_Multi-Frequency_Image_Illusion
This project combines the high frequency and the low frequency components of different images to create an illusion. Up close, one can perceive the high frequency component and from far away one can see the low frequency component.
## How to run code?
1. Download the Grayscale_Hybrid_Image_Code.ipynb file from the <a href="https://github.com/p-Dhyey/Hybrid_Multi-Frequency_Image_Illusion/tree/2bbdd6d978872ed01ba71ae3dbaecd044b09c12c/Codes">Codes</a> section in repository.
2. Open browser -> Google Colab -> Upload the downloaded file
3. After uploading file, once file open go to "Files" section from bar on left side.
4. Once you open that you have to wait for sometime till it coonnects the runtime environment.
