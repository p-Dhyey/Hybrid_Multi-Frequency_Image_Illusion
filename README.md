# Hybrid_Multi-Frequency_Image_Illusion
This project combines the high frequency and the low frequency components of different images to create an illusion. Up close, one can perceive the high frequency component and from far away one can see the low frequency component.
## How to run code?
1. Download the Grayscale_Hybrid_Image_Code.ipynb file from the <a href="https://github.com/p-Dhyey/Hybrid_Multi-Frequency_Image_Illusion/tree/2bbdd6d978872ed01ba71ae3dbaecd044b09c12c/Codes">Codes</a> section in repository.
2. Download images according to their name convention from <a href="https://github.com/p-Dhyey/Hybrid_Multi-Frequency_Image_Illusion/tree/190e9f1c41adfe635db2c2f9bbd149a816f84f2f/Test_Images">Test_Images</a> section in pair (face1, face2).
3. Open browser -> Google Colab -> Upload the downloaded file
4. After uploading file, once file open go to "Files" section from bar on left side.
5. Go to "Upload" option -> upload the two images downloaded before.
6. Copy the path of face1 to low frequency image component (mentioned in code comment).
7. Similarly, copy the path of face2 to high frequency image component(mentioned in code comment).
8. Run the cell one by one, you will see the matrix of images of all processing step.
9. And final hybrid illusion image in bottom right corner of matrix.
